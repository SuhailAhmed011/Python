# the __init__ function is a special method (also called a dunder method 
# because of the double underscores) that acts like a constructor in object-oriented programming.
# It initializes an object when a class is created.
# It sets up initial values for the objectâ€™s attributes.
# It is automatically called right after an object is created with the ClassName() syntax.
